### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Toby and i'm a software developer.

I've hacked away at the codeface professionally since 2004, and for fun since 1998 (this might be the other way around!)

Alumnus of Friends Reunited (No github, sorry), (Brightsolid)[https://github.com/brightsolid], [NCC Group](https://github.com/nccgroup) and [TruRating](https://github.com/trurating)
